Welcome to Hamdiz Truly Random Multi-ID Generator (`MIG`), a versatile and robust ID generation tool for the `ESP32` platform.
This project is designed to generate various types of unique IDs with advanced features such as streaming, customizable output destinations, and peripheral validation. 🎉

⚙️ **Prerequisites**

Before using the Hamdiz Truly Random Multi-ID Generator (`MIG`), ensure you have installed all necessary dependencies and configured your environment correctly:

📚 **Required Libraries**:

	1.	Wire.h: For I2C communication (used for LCD validation or other I2C peripherals).
	2.	SD.h: For SD card operations.
	3.	SPI.h: Required for interfacing with the SD card module.
	4.	WiFi.h: For WiFi connectivity (used for API integration).
	5.	HTTPClient.h: For sending HTTP requests to an API.
	6.	EEPROM.h: For saving and retrieving setup data persistently.

🖧 **Baud Rate Configuration**:

	•	Set the Serial Monitor to **921600** baud to ensure proper communication with the ESP32. 🛠️

🛠️ **Installation Instructions**:

	1.	Open the Arduino IDE.
	2.	Navigate to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
	3.	Search for and install the required libraries listed above if not already installed.
	4.	Configure your Serial Monitor’s baud rate to **921600**.

	⚠️ Failing to set up these dependencies or configure the baud rate may result in the project not functioning as expected.

**📝 Commands**

**ID Generation**:

	•	int <length>: Generate a random integer with the specified length. 🔢
	•	uuid v1: Generate a UUID Version 1 (timestamp-based). ⏰
	•	uuid v4: Generate a UUID Version 4 (random). 🎲
	•	hex <length>: Generate a random hexadecimal string. 🛠️
	•	base64 <length>: Generate a Base64 string. 🔐
	•	alphanum <length>: Generate an alphanumeric string. 🔡
	•	bin <length>: Generate a binary string. 🧮
	•	custom <set> <length>: Generate a string using a custom character set. 🎨

**Data Management**:

	•	save <filename>: Save generated output to a file on the SD card. 💾
	•	read: Read and display the contents of a output.txt from the SD card. 📖

**Streaming**:

	•	stream <command> <interval>: Continuously execute a command at a specified interval (in milliseconds). 🔄
	•	stop stream: Stop the currently active streaming mode. ❌

**Setup**:

	•	setup: Configure the output destination (Serial, File, or API). ⚙️

**🔧 Usage**

**First Run**:

	1.	Setup Configuration:
	•	Specify the output destination:
	•	Serial: Prints to Serial Monitor. 💻
	•	File: Saves to a specified file on an SD card. 📂
	•	API: Sends data to a configured API endpoint. 🌐
	•	For API output, configure:
	•	URL 🌐
	•	Payload format 📦
	•	Authentication (Bearer or Basic) 🔑
	2.	Command Execution:
	•	Input commands via the Serial Monitor to generate IDs or manage data. 💬
	3.	Streaming Mode:
	•	Use the stream command to automate ID generation. 🔄

**🛠️ Error Handling**:

	•	If a required peripheral (e.g., SD card) is missing, a clear warning is displayed. ⚠️
	•	Invalid commands or inputs are handled gracefully with detailed error messages. 🚨

**🔄 Advanced Configuration**:

Modify the setup anytime using the setup command:
	•	Change the output destination. ⚙️
	•	Reconfigure API settings. 🌐
	•	Update authentication details. 🔑

**📌 Project Details**

	•	Author: Ahmad Hamdi
	•	Platform: ESP32
	•	Libraries Used:
	•	Wire.h (I2C communication) 📟
	•	SD.h and SPI.h (SD card operations) 📂
	•	WiFi.h and HTTPClient.h (API integration) 🌐
	•	EEPROM.h (Persistent data storage) 💾

**🔍 Example Workflow**:

	1.	Generate a UUID v4:

uuid v4


	2.	Stream random integers every 2 seconds:

stream int 16 2000


	3.	Save IDs to a file:

save output.txt


	4.	Read and print the file content:

read


	5.	Send data to an API:

Sending data to an API is an automated process that you should not use directly;
Instead, set the configuration to output to a specific API.
sendToAPI("https://example.com/api", "{\"id\":\"12345\"}", "bearer", "your-token")

**📌 Notes**:

	•	First Run Setup: Setup must be completed on the first run and can be modified later. 🛠️
	•	Return to Normal Mode: Use stop stream to exit streaming mode. 🔄

Enjoy using Hamdiz Truly Random Multi-ID Generator (`MIG`)! 🚀🎉
